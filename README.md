Data science analysis of football matches

## Current status

I am interested in the distribution of goal-scoring depending on game time and score so far.

I found some data available at http://www.rsssfbrasil.com/, however the data is not formatted nicely. It needs more work to parse it correctly.

There is also data about the World Cup at http://www.rsssf.com/tables/20xxfull.html after 2002.
